# Cookie Guardian - Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** December 24, 2024

## Overview
Cookie Guardian is a browser extension that automatically deletes cookies to protect your privacy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

### What the extension stores locally (on your device only):
- Your settings and preferences
- Your whitelist of trusted domains
- Statistics about cookies deleted (counts only, not cookie contents)
- Premium purchase status

### What we do NOT collect:
- Cookie contents or values
- Browsing history
- Personal information
- Any data transmitted to external servers

## How It Works
Cookie Guardian deletes cookies from your browser. The cookies are permanently removed—they are not collected, stored, or sent anywhere.

## Third-Party Services
Premium features are processed through ExtensionPay. Payment processing is handled by Stripe through ExtensionPay. We do not have access to your full payment details.

## Data Storage
All extension data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. No data leaves your device except for payment processing when upgrading to premium.
